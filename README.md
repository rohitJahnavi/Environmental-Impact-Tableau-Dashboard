# Environmental-Impact-Tableau-Dashboard
# 1. Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a Tableau dashboard to visualize and analyze the environmental impact of various operations across industries and regions. The dashboard provides actionable insights into:

* Carbon emissions

* Water consumption

* Energy usage

* Waste generation

* Recycling rates

* Air quality

* Compliance levels

# 2. Objectives and Goals

* Visualize Environmental Metrics: Provide an interactive view of key environmental metrics.

* Compare Across Dimensions: Enable comparisons across regions, industries, product types, and compliance levels.

* Monitor Trends: Display trends over time to identify patterns and opportunities for improvement.

* Enhance Decision-Making: Support strategic decisions to improve environmental compliance and reduce negative impact.

# 3. Scope

In Scope:

* Data visualization and interactive filtering for key environmental metrics.

* Comparative analysis across regions, industries, and product types.
  
* Exportable reports and charts.

Out of Scope:

* Predictive analytics or forecasting.

* Real-time data integration.

* Detailed operational-level drill-downs beyond the provided dataset.

# 4. Stakeholders

* Business Users: Sustainability teams, compliance officers, and operations managers.

* IT Team: Responsible for data integration and Tableau setup.

* Executives: Interested in high-level insights and compliance performance.

#5. Data Requirements

* Dataset: 50,000 records with the following columns:

* Carbon Emissions (kg)

* Water Consumption (liters)

* Energy Usage (kWh)

* Waste Generated (kg)

* Recycling Rate (%)

* Air Quality Index (AQI)

* Data Format: CSV file, provided as input.

* Data Validation: Ensure integrity, completeness, and removal of inconsistencies.

6. Functional Requirements

Filters:

* Region

* Industry

* Product Type

* Compliance Level

* Charts and Visuals:

* Bar Chart: Carbon emissions by region.

* Line Chart: Trends of energy usage over time.

* Heatmap: Recycling rates by industry and region.

* Pie Chart: Distribution of compliance levels.

* Scatter Plot: Relationship between carbon emissions and recycling rates.

Interactivity:

* Dynamic filtering and drill-down capabilities.

* Hover tooltips displaying additional data.

* Export options for visuals and underlying data.

# 7. Non-Functional Requirements

* Performance: Dashboards must load within 5 seconds for up to 100,000 records.

* Accessibility: Ensure compatibility with major browsers and devices.

* Scalability: Prepare for potential integration of additional datasets.
